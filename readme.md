Ly is a lightweight TUI (ncurses-like) display manager for Linux and BSD.

## Dependencies
 - a C99 compiler (tested with tcc and gcc)
 - a C standard library
 - GNU make
 - pam
 - xcb
 - xorg
 - xorg-xauth
 - mcookie
 - tput
 - shutdown

On Debian-based distros running `apt install build-essential libpam0g-dev libxcb-xkb-dev` as root should install all the dependencies for you. 
For Fedora try running `dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel pam-devel libxcb-devel`

## Support
The following desktop environments were tested with success

 - awesome
 - bspwm
 - budgie
 - cinnamon
 - deepin
 - dwm 
 - enlightenment
 - gnome
 - i3
 - kde
 - lxde
 - lxqt
 - mate
 - maxx 
 - pantheon
 - qtile
 - spectrwm
 - sway
 - windowmaker 
 - xfce
 - xmonad

Ly should work with any X desktop environment, and provides
basic wayland support (sway works very well, for example).

## systemd?
Unlike what you may have heard, Ly does not require `systemd`,
and was even specifically designed not to depend on `logind`.
You should be able to make it work easily with a better init,
changing the source code won't be necessary :)

## Cloning and Compiling
Clone the repository
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fairyglade/ly
```

Change the directory to ly
```
$ cd ly
```

Compile
```
$ make
```

Test in the configured tty (tty2 by default)
or a terminal emulator (but desktop environments won't start)
```
# make run
```

Install Ly and the provided systemd service file
```
# make install installsystemd
```

Enable the service
```
# systemctl enable ly.service
```

If you need to switch between ttys after Ly's start you also have to
disable getty on Ly's tty to prevent "login" from spawning on top of it
```
# systemctl disable getty@tty2.service
```

### OpenRC

Clone, compile and test.

Install Ly and the provided OpenRC service
```
# make install installopenrc
```

Enable the service
```
# rc-update add ly
```

You can edit which tty Ly will start on by editing the `tty` option in the configuration file.

If you choose a tty that already has a login/getty running (has a basic login prompt), then you have to disable the getty so it doesn't respawn on top of ly
```
# rc-update del agetty.tty2
```

### runit

```
$ make
# make install installrunit
# ln -s /etc/sv/ly /var/service/
```

Disable your existing display manager service if need be e.g.:

```
# rm /var/service/lxdm
```

If you are running on `tty2` (check your `/etc/ly/config.ini`) you can disable e.g. `agetty` running there:

```
# rm /var/service/agetty-tty2
```

## Arch Linux Installation
You can install ly from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ly), using yay for example:
``` 
$ yay -S ly
```

## Configuration
You can find all the configuration in `/etc/ly/config.ini`.
The file is commented, and includes the default values.

## Controls
Use the up and down arrow keys to change the current field, and the
left and right arrow keys to change the target desktop environment
while on the desktop field (above the login field).

## .xinitrc
If your .xinitrc doesn't work make sure it is executable and includes a shebang.
This file is supposed to be a shell script! Quoting from xinit's man page:

> If no specific client program is given on the command line, xinit will look for a file in the user's home directory called .xinitrc to run as a shell script to start up client programs.

On Arch Linux, the example .xinitrc (/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc) starts like this:
```
#!/bin/sh
```

## Tips
The numlock and capslock state is printed in the top-right corner.
Use the F1 and F2 keys to respectively shutdown and reboot.
Take a look at your .xsession if X doesn't start, as it can interfere
(this file is launched with X to configure the display properly).

## PSX DOOM fire animation
To enable the famous PSX DOOM fire described by [Fabien Sanglard](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html),
just uncomment `animate = true` in `/etc/ly/config.ini`. You may also
disable the main box borders with `hide_borders = true`.

## Additional Information
The name "Ly" is a tribute to the fairy from the game Rayman.
Ly was tested by oxodao, who is some seriously awesome dude.
