# The color settings in Ly take a digit 0-8 corresponding to:
#define TB_DEFAULT 0x00
#define TB_BLACK   0x01
#define TB_RED     0x02
#define TB_GREEN   0x03
#define TB_YELLOW  0x04
#define TB_BLUE    0x05
#define TB_MAGENTA 0x06
#define TB_CYAN    0x07
#define TB_WHITE   0x08
# The default color varies, but usually it makes the background black and the foreground white.
# You can also combine these colors with the following style attributes using bitwise OR:
#define TB_BOLD      0x0100
#define TB_UNDERLINE 0x0200
#define TB_REVERSE   0x0400
#define TB_ITALIC    0x0800
#define TB_BLINK     0x1000
#define TB_HI_BLACK  0x2000
#define TB_BRIGHT    0x4000
#define TB_DIM       0x8000
# For example, to set the foreground color to red and bold, you would do 0x02 | 0x0100 = 0x0102.
# Note that you must pre-calculate the value because Ly doesn't parse bitwise OR operations in its config.
#
# Moreover, to set the VT color palette, you are encouraged to use another tool such as
# mkinitcpio-colors (https://github.com/evanpurkhiser/mkinitcpio-colors). Note that the color palette defined with
# mkinitcpio-colors takes 16 colors (0-15), only values 0-8 are valid with Ly and these values do not correspond
# exactly. For instance, in defining palettes with mkinitcpio-colors, the order is black, dark red, dark green, brown, dark
# blue, dark purple, dark cyan, light gray, dark gray, bright red, bright green, yellow, bright blue, bright purple, bright
# cyan, and white, indexed in that order 0 through 15. For example, the color defined for white (indexed at 15 in the mkinitcpio
# config) will be used by Ly for fg = 0x0008.
