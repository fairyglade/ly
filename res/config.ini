# Ly supports 24-bit true color with styling, which means each color is a 32-bit value.
# The format is 0xSSRRGGBB, where SS is the styling, RR is red, GG is green, and BB is blue.
# Here are the possible styling options:
#define TB_BOLD      0x01000000
#define TB_UNDERLINE 0x02000000
#define TB_REVERSE   0x04000000
#define TB_ITALIC    0x08000000
#define TB_BLINK     0x10000000
#define TB_HI_BLACK  0x20000000
#define TB_BRIGHT    0x40000000
#define TB_DIM       0x80000000
# Programmatically, you'd apply them using the bitwise OR operator (|), but because Ly's
# configuration doesn't support using it, you have to manually compute the color value.
# Note that, if you want to use the default color value of the terminal, you can use the
# special value 0x00000000. This means that, if you want to use black, you *must* use
# the styling option TB_HI_BLACK (the RGB values are ignored when using this option).
